# Rehab Potential-milestone project
## Introduction
This is my first milestone project, Rehab Potential

Since 2012 my wife and myself owned this comapny Rehab Potential Inc. which is physical therapy clinic. I always had a dream of developing a website for our company which can give a new look. As I thought of changing my career and enrolled into Full Stack Develepment course I had imagined to develop a project related to our comapany,

Reason of this project is to put all what I learned and understood, the concepts of HTML and CSS put together a fully responsive static website.

I will run you through the steps to my project and putting all the efforts behind the design along with the user experience.

Thank You for all your help for which I was able to put together my very first project
